AIDLBoundService
This project demostrates the usage of AIDL in android.
Scenario 1:
1) Server (is a service running remotely - in another process) provides random no within 100 on request.
2) Client is Activity which is bound to the remote service

Key Notes:
1) usage of data binding using Butterknife (similar to dagger)
2) aidl
3) asynchronous RPC calls
